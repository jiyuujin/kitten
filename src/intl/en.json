The name comes from the fact that he loves cats, which is his characteristic, and that he is good at the front end as an individual Web developer, and that he is also very interested in infrastructure. <br /> At that time, Contentful, one of the Headless CMS, was running. There was an urgent need to have a product as an individual that is not affected by any external influences, such as the fact that we could not meet a permanent product even in the work scene and ended up in the middle of the process. Production has started based on Nuxt.js (v1.0.0-rc.11 at that time).",
